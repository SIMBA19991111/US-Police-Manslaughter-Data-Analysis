# Fatal Force Database (v2)

## About the data

Each day researchers at The Post identify and manually record data for fatal police shootings in the United States. Each record requires at least two sources and must be approved by our editors before being publicly released.

Data about each fatal shooting is provided via two comma-separated value (CSV) files:

**Death Record** data for each victim and incident is included in `/v2/fatal-police-shootings-data.csv`. 

New in v2 is a second **Agencies** csv, `/v2/fatal-police-shootings-agencies.csv`, which contains data for police agencies involved in at least one fatal police shooting since 2015. The agencies csv has a field called `agency_ids`, which can be used to associate each death record with the agencies involved.

To enable joining this dataset with other federal law enforcement datasets, in 2022 The Post undertook an effort to increase the coverage of federal Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) codes recorded for agencies in the database. Using agency data from the FBI and Department of Justice, reporters did a combination of automated and manual name and ORI code matching to fill in missing ORI code data. They also standardized department names. Agency naming, organization, hierarchy and classification varies from state to state. For this reason, sub-agencies and local troops, regions and posts have been aggregated into their parent agencies, meaning that in some cases an individual agency will have multiple associated ORI codes. For instance, a state police department may have the ORI codes of multiple barracks associated with it.

### Major data schema changes between version 1 and version 2

The Post created version 2 of this dataset in 2022 to refine and better define data categories, as well as improve documentation about how the data is obtained and classified. In addition to the altering of fields and formatting, a separate agencies dataset has been added which includes information on the law enforcement agencies which have been involved in at least one fatal shooting since 2015.

**High-level summary of major changes to the data schema introduced in version 2:**

V1 field | V2 Field | Context
---|---|---|
`manner_of_death` | field removed  | This database tracks fatal police shootings. Other weapons (e.g. a Taser) may be involved in the encounter, but the manner of death for victims in these records is always a police shooting. Thus, the field was removed.
`race` (single)| `race` (multiple) | Field converted from a single option to a list of options. Previously multi-racial or multi-ethnic victims were tracked using the `Other` option. This update allows us to more accurately categorize shootings of individuals with multiple ethnic and racial backgrounds.
-- |`race_source` | This field was added to identify the source from which race was determined, which can range from court documents to a researchers' assessment based on a victim's photograph.
`threat_level` | `threat_type`| Renamed field to more accurately portray data we have collected, while removing implication of hierarchy.
`signs_of_mental_illness` |  `was_mental_illness_related` | Renamed field to more accurately portray data we have collected when news accounts or police reports reflect a victim may have had a history of mental health issues or was experiencing mental distress at the time of the shooting.
`flee` | `flee_status`| Renamed field to more accurately portray data we collected
`armed` | `armed_with` | This field originally included the specific weapon if the victim had one and otherwise indicated `unarmed`, `undetermined`, or `unknown`. It has been updated to use federal classifications based on NIBRS, the national incident-level crime reporting system. `toy` category has been renamed to `replica`.
`is_geocoding_exact`|  field removed | Location information for an incident is often only available at the block level (eg. 100 Block of Main St). Precision and accuracy of geocoded location information was not sufficiently represented by this field. 
|-- | `location_precision`| New field to indicate the precision level of the location data which was geocoded to generate the record's coordinate data.
| -- | `agency_ids`| List of agency ids to enable joining with the agencies csv.

### Death Records

**File:** `/v2/fatal-police-shootings-data.csv` 

**Summary:** Death record data about each incident and victim. The file can be downloaded at this URL. Victim information is obtained from any available recordings of the incident, news accounts, court records and/or official statements.

**Fields:**

| ---| --- | ---- | ---|
| **Incident information** |

Please note that the precision and accuracy of incident coordinates varies depending on the precision of the input address which is often only available at the block level. | decimal number |`47.246826`|
|`longitude`| The longitude location of the shooting expressed as WGS84 coordinates, geocoded from addresses.| decimal number|`-123.121592`|

*Note:* `threat_type` and `flee_status` are not necessarily related. For example, there may be an incident in which the suspect is fleeing and at the same time turns to fire at gun at the officer.
